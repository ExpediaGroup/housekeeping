# Overview
A database-backed module that stores orphaned paths in a table for later clean up.

# Housekeeping Configuration
The housekeeping module defaults to using the H2 Database Engine, however this module can be configured
to use any flavour of SQL database that is supported by JDBC, Spring Boot and Hibernate. Using a database which is not in-memory should be preferred when spinning up short-lived instances for jobs before tearing them down. This ensures that the orphaned data will be stored in a persistent database and will be considered for housekeeping even if the cluster ceases to exist.

## Database Connectors
In order to connect to your SQL database, you must place a database connector jar that is compatible with your Database onto your application's classpath.

## Spring YAML Housekeeping Configuration
If your project utilises Spring YAML you can define your Housekeeping within the YAML. For example:

    housekeeping:
      # Name of the schema/database to use - defaults to housekeeping 
      schema-name: housekeeping
      # Location of the script file to initialize the schema - defaults to classpath:/schema.sql 
      db-init-script: classpath:/schema.sql
      # Connection details
      data-source:
        # The package of your driver class
        driver-class-name: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
        # JDBC URL for your Database
        url: jdbc:mysql://housekeeping.foo1baz123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/${housekeeping.schema-name}
        # Database Username
        username: bdp
        # Database Password
        password: Ch4ll3ng3

You can override Spring Boot (HikariCP/Hibernate) settings in the YAML by providing the relevant properties. Housekeeping defaults are added with lower precedence. For example, to override the default connection pool maximum active size to 5 add this:

    spring.datasource.max-active: 5 
    
 Refer to the Spring Boot documentation for a full list of properties that can be set.   
    
## Programmatic Housekeeping Configuration
Housekeeping allows you to configure your housekeeping job in a more fine grained manner by providing a certain set of Spring beans in your application.

You can configure your housekeeping data source in code by defining the bean `DataSource housekeepingDataSource(...)`. For example:

    @Bean(destroyMethod = "close")
    DataSource housekeepingDataSource(
        String driverClassName,
        String jdbcUrl,
        String username,
        String encryptedPassword) {
      return DataSourceBuilder
          .create()
          .driverClassName(driverClassName)
          .url(jdbcUrl)
          .username(username)
          .password(encryptedPassword)
          .build();
    }

Housekeeping comes with a default `HousekeepingService` implementation, however you can choose to provide your own. To run housekeeping you must provide a `HousekeepingService` bean which either constructs the default `FileSystemHousekeepingService` or a custom implementation of the `HousekeepingService` interface:

    @Bean
    HousekeepingService housekeepingService(
        LegacyReplicaPathRepository legacyReplicaPathRepository) {
      return new FileSystemHousekeepingService(legacyReplicaPathRepository, new org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration());
    }

The default provided housekeeping implementation creates a database named `housekeeping` and a table named `legacy_replica_path` to store the housekeeping data. To enable this database you must provide a _schema.sql_ file which contains any SQL code that must be run to initialise your database upon application startup. This is particularly important if running Housekeeping in your application for the first time.

An example _schema.sql_ file for use with the default housekeeping entity configuration is given below:

    CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS housekeeping;

Applications which leverage housekeeping support can define their own schema and table within which housekeeping data is to be stored. This can be achieved by following the steps below.

You must create your database initialisation _schema.sql_ script and either add it to your classpath, provide it as a resource in your application or configure the path to it via the YAML configuration property `housekeeping.db-init-script`. The simplest _schema.sql_ initialisation script will create your schema if it does not exist.

     CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS my_custom_schema;

The database name must be configured in the YAML property `housekeeping.schema-name`.

Whether you are using a custom housekeeping configuration, or the defaults, your application must provide two crucial annotations which will load the Entities and CrudRepositories that you require. These are the `@EntityScan` and `@EnableJpaRepositories` annotations. These annotations are best demonstrated in an example:

    //The class annotated with `@Entity` that defines the required LegacyReplicaPath implementation
    @EntityScan(basePackageClasses = HousekeepingLegacyReplicaPath.class)
    //The class which extends LegacyReplicaPathRepository and contains your desired `CrudRepository` implementation
    @EnableJpaRepositories(basePackageClasses = HousekeepingLegacyReplicaPathRepository.class)
    
### Customising the Housekeeping table name

By default Housekeeping will create a `legacy_replica_path` table in the specified schema. If you need to customize the table name you can do this by extending the base classes and configuring the JPA annotations as desired. The class which extends `EntityLegacyReplicaPath` must be annotated with the `@Entity` annotation and the `@Table` annotation. An example is given below which will provide the basis for creating a schema named `my_custom_schema` in your database, and a table named `my_custom_replica_path` within the `my_custom_schema` schema.  

    @Entity
    @Table(schema = "my_custom_schema", name = "my_custom_replica_path",
           uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = { "path", "creation_timestamp" }))
    public class MyJobsLegacyReplicaPath extends EntityLegacyReplicaPath {
      //required inherited constructors etc. go here
    }

To accompany the custom `EntityLegacyReplicaPath` implementation you need to extend the `LegacyReplicaPathRepository` interface providing the custom `EntityLegacyReplicaPath` implementation as a generic type argument. This simplifies the creation of a `CrudRepository` for your `EntityLegacyReplicaPath`. For example:

    public interface MyJobLegacyReplicaPathRepository
        extends LegacyReplicaPathRepository<MyJobsLegacyReplicaPath> {
    }

## Password Encryption
Housekeeping allows you to provide encrypted passwords in your configuration or programs. The Housekeeping project depends on the [jasypt library](http://www.jasypt.org/download.html) that can be used to generate encrypted passwords which in turn can be decrypted by Spring Boot's jasypt support.

An encrypted password can be generated by doing the following:

    java -cp jasypt-1.9.2.jar  org.jasypt.intf.cli.JasyptPBEStringEncryptionCLI input="Ch4ll3ng3" password=db_password algorithm=PBEWithMD5AndDES

    ----ENVIRONMENT-----------------

    Runtime: Oracle Corporation OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 25.121-b13


    ----ARGUMENTS-------------------

    algorithm: PBEWithMD5AndDES
    input: Ch4ll3ng3
    password: db_password


    ----OUTPUT----------------------

    EHL/foiBKY2Ucy3oYmxdkFiXzWnOu7by

The 'input' is your database password. The 'password' is a password specified by you that can be used to decrypt the data.
The 'output' is your encrypted password. This encrypted password can then be used in the yaml configuration:

    housekeeping:
      data-source:
        #The package of your driver class
        driver-class-name: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
        #JDBC URL for your Database
        url: jdbc:mysql://housekeeping.foo1baz123.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:3306/housekeeping_db
        #Database Username
        username: bdp
        #Encrypted Database Password
        password: ENC(EHL/foiBKY2Ucy3oYmxdkFiXzWnOu7by)

Or be decrypted from special properties file(s) on your classpath:

    @Configuration
    @EncryptablePropertySources({@EncryptablePropertySource("classpath:encrypted.properties"), @EncryptablePropertySource("classpath:encrypted2.properties")})
    public class MyApplication {
      ...
    }

The encrypted.properties file would look something like this:

        database.username=ENC(nrmZtkF7T0kjG/VodDvBw93Ct8EgjCA+)
        database.password=ENC(EHL/foiBKY2Ucy3oYmxdkFiXzWnOu7by)

You can then access the decrypted username and password in your application by doing something akin to the following:

    private @Autowired ConfigurableEnvironment env;

    @Bean(destroyMethod = "close")
    DataSource housekeepingDataSource(
        String driverClassName,
        String jdbcUrl) {

      String username = env.getProperty("database.username");
      String password = env.getProperty("database.password");

      return DataSourceBuilder
          .create()
          .driverClassName(driverClassName)
          .url(jdbcUrl)
          .username(username)
          .password(password)
          .build();
    }

Or

    @Bean(destroyMethod = "close")
    DataSource housekeepingDataSource(
        String driverClassName,
        String jdbcUrl,
        @Value("${database.username}") username,
        @Value("${database.password}") password) {
      return DataSourceBuilder
          .create()
          .driverClassName(driverClassName)
          .url(jdbcUrl)
          .username(username)
          .password(password)
          .build();
    }


Finally, if you are using an encrypted password, when you run your application you must provide the application with your
jasypt.encryptor.password 

There are a few approaches to doing so:

Run your application with the jasypt.encryptor.password parameter:

    java jar <your-jar>  --jasypt.encryptor.password=db_password

Pass jasypt.encryptor.password as a system property by creating application.properties or application.yml and adding:

    jasypt.encryptor.password=${JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD:}

Or in YAML

    jasypt:
      encryptor:
        password: ${JASYPT_ENCRYPTOR_PASSWORD:}


# Housekeeping Vacuum Tool
A tool that can be used to interrogate and remove orphaned data which has been scheduled for Housekeeping.

### Usage

Run with your respective replication YAML configuration file:

    $HOUSEKEEPING_TOOL_HOME/bin/vacuum.sh \
      --config=<your-config>.yml \
      [--dry-run=true] \
      [--partition-batch-size=1000] \
      [--expected-path-count=10000]

Vacuum looks for any files and folders in the data locations of your replicated tables that are not referenced in either the metastore or housekeeping database. Any paths discovered are again scheduled for removal via the housekeeping process. The respective files and folders will then be removed at a time determined by the specific configuration of your housekeeping process.

We use the housekeeping process for data removal in this scenario as it has useful logic for determining when ancestral paths can also be removed.

More information on configuring the housekeeping-vacuum-tool can be found [here](housekeeping-vacuum-tool/README.md)
